                 A web application is an application software that does not require installation
                 and can instead be accessed from a remote server via web browser.
                 Web applications are made for interaction, allowing users to send
                 and consume data between the browser and the web server.
                 This interaction can be as simple as logging in to an account,
                 or as complex as making a payment with your credit card.

             <!--Put a paragraph tag to put a description of the site-->
             <p>
                 While the terms website and web application are often used interchangeably,
                 they can denote somewhat different things.
                 Most commonly, a website is defined as a set of information-carrying pages
                 that are inter-related and accessed through a web browser.
                 A web application, on the other hand, is an application software
                 that runs on a web server and is accessed by the user through a web browser.

                 If a website could be said to be defined by its content,
                 then a web application would be defined by its interaction with the user.
                 As such, web applications are significantly more complicated than static websites,
                 both in general architecture and features.

             <h2>Web Application Architecture: </h2>

             <p>
                 In order to facilitate this complex flow of data,
                 web applications are usually designed with different layers.
                 The most common design paradigm is a three-layered design
                 consisting of a presentation layer (web browser),
                 application layer (server), and storage layer (database).
                 In this system, the presentation layer is responsible for
                 relaying user data to the application layer, which can process
                 that data and do any number of things, including passing it to the storage layer for “safe-keeping.”

                 Many times, web applications can grow to be very complex.
                 In these cases, a three-layered design may fall short.
                 This may necessitate the introduction of additional layers to handle this complexity.
                 For instance, the introduction of an integration layer between the application
                 and storage layers can help provide a uniform interface for data access,
                 allowing the application layer to be insulated from changes that occur to the storage layer implementation.

                 Databases are commonly used on the back-end of web applications.
                 These databases provide an interface to save data in a persistent way to memory.
                 Storing the data in a database both reduces the load on the main memory of the server
                 CPU and allows the data to be retrieved if the server crashes or loses power.

                 Many requests sent to the server might require a database query.
                 A client might request information that is stored in the database,
                 or a client might submit data with their request to be added to the database.

                 Examples of intranet-based services include internal communications,
                 knowledge management systems, and collaboration tools.

                 Examples of Internet-based services include email,
                 social media, search engines, and online shopping sites.
